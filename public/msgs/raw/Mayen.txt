Hi Mayen! Gosh it's so weird to call you Mayen, especially since 'mahal', 'labs', 'babs', etc. na ang tawag ko sayo. Anw, I did it mahal! Thank you for being part of my life esp this college! Thank you for being Mayen, my Mayen (di kita pag mamay-ari pero gets mo na yan). Thank you for being always there for me. Thank you for being the cutest, understanding, beautiful, caring person in my life. Legit, the Gab would not be the Gab you know, without you. You've always made me feel loved and cared about, and maybe that's my motivation to strive for more! Kaya mahal, I really appreciate you! Mahal na mahal kita!
